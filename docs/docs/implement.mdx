# Fast-track Knowledge As A Service with ToolJump in Your Company

ToolJump connects your developers' tools (GitHub, cloud, CI/CD, monitoring, etc.) so context, knowledge, and navigation are right where engineers work - no more tribal knowledge, wasted time, or costly mistakes.

:::tip
ToolJump is fully open source, free to use, and keeps all your data inside your company.

## Why Work With Me Instead of Allocating Developers?

While your engineers *could* set up ToolJump on their own, doing so usually means weeks of trial & error and time pulled from critical projects. I've already solved these challenges and can deliver a working rollout in weeks instead of months - without disrupting your roadmap and bringing battle-tested DevEx expertise into your organization.

> **Most importantly:** This isn't just about convenience. It's about **Developer Productivity** and **Developer Experience (DevEx)** - two areas every forward-thinking company invests in.
> - Better DevEx â†’ higher retention, happier engineers, fewer mistakes.  
> - Higher productivity â†’ faster delivery, more features shipped, and a stronger bottom line.

## What's Included in Implementation

**Seamless Integration**  
Connect ToolJump with your internal auth (Okta, Google Workspace, etc.) and roll it out securely across your company.

**Tailored Rollout**  
I'll identify your developers' biggest bottlenecks and deliver the highest-value integrations first - so you see impact immediately.

**Team Enablement**  
Train your engineers to maintain snippets as code, own their integrations, and ensure everything follows your security and compliance standards.

**Enterprise Features & Support**  
Access to enterprise-grade capabilities (SSO, RBAC, audit logs, advanced integrations) with ongoing support to keep ToolJump evolving with your stack.

> **The result:** A measurable uplift in **developer productivity and DevEx** - your engineers spend less time fighting tools and more time building.

## Typical Timeline

Most implementations are complete and live across your organization within **2-4 weeks**, depending on your stack complexity and team size.
