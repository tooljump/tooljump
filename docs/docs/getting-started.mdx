# Getting Started with ToolJump

ToolJump revolutionizes [developer experience](/docs/developer-experience) by making it easy to [connect your tools](/docs/connecting-your-tools-resources) - GitHub, AWS, Datadog, CI/CD, and more - with a single context bar that delivers [Knowledge as a Service](/docs/knowledge-as-a-service) directly in your workflow. Get started in just a few minutes with our step-by-step guide.


---

## Step 1: Install the Chrome Extension

<ChromeExtensionLink />


<br/>The extension installs in <strong>Demo Mode</strong>, so you can see ToolJump in action immediately.

### Pin the Extension
Make sure to pin the ToolJump extension to your Chrome toolbar for easy access:

<img src="/img/pin.png" alt="Pin the ToolJump extension" style={{display: 'block', margin: '2rem auto', borderRadius: 8, width: '550px'}} />

---

## Step 2: Try the Demo

Visit <DemoRepoLink /> to see ToolJump in action. This is just a demo so that you can see how ToolJump would look like on your repositories (or other engineering tools). You'll see a context bar at the top of the GitHub page showing:

- **Real-time alerts** from your monitoring tools
- **Quick links** to logs, costs, and deployment status  
- **Team information** like who's on-call
- **Environment URLs** for different deployments

To adapt it to your company and workflows, follow the next steps!

<BarContentPreview 
  data={[
    { type: 'link', content: '3 alerts', href: 'https://www.npmjs.com/package/lunr-languages', status: 'important', icon: 'datadog' },
    { type: 'link', content: 'Logs', href: 'https://www.npmjs.com/package/lunr-languages', icon: 'datadog' },
    { type: 'link', content: 'Cost 30d: $351', href: 'https://www.npmjs.com/package/lunr-languages' },
    { type: 'link', content: 'Oncall: John', href: 'https://www.npmjs.com/package/lunr-languages', icon: 'pagerduty' },
    { type: 'link', content: 'Deployed 3d ago', href: 'https://www.npmjs.com/package/lunr-languages', icon: 'circleci' },
    { 
        type: 'dropdown',
        content: 'URLs',
        items: [
            { content: 'Dev: http://dev.my.service', href: 'http://dev.my.service' },
            { content: 'QA: http://qa.my.service', href: 'http://qa.my.service' },
            { content: 'Prod: http://prod.my.service', href: 'http://prod.my.service', status: 'important' }
        ]
    }
  ]}

<div className="alert alert--success">
  <strong>Demo Mode:</strong> This shows sample data. To connect your real tools, continue to Step 3.
</div>

## Step 3: Set Up Your Server locally

To connect your actual tools and data, you'll need to run your own ToolJump server.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have these installed:
- **Node.js 20+** 
- **Yarn** or **NPM**

### Quick Setup

1. **Create your server:**
   ```bash
   npx create-tooljump
   ```

2. **Run npm install:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Configure the extension:**
   - Open ToolJump extension settings
   - Turn off "Demo Mode"
   - Enter your server URL and the secure token you chose at step 1

   <img src="/img/settings.png" alt="Extension Settings" width="280" style={{ boxShadow: '0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06)', display: 'block', margin: '1rem auto' }} />

5. **Test the connection:**
   Visit <ConfigValue 
     name="tooljumpRepoUrl" 
     render={(url) => <a href={String(url)}>{String(url)}</a>} 
   /> and you should see your ToolJump bar!

The server comes with a few demo integrations that showcase what's possible with ToolJump.

## Step 4: Build Your First Integration

Now that your setup works, it's time to connect your tools and build custom integrations.

<div className="card">
  <div className="card__header">
    <h4 className="card__title">Ready to build?</h4>
    <p className="card__subtitle">Learn how to create integrations for your specific tools and workflows or browse our gallery of predefined integrations connecting more than 10+ tools.</p>
  </div>
  <div className="card__content" style={{ display: 'flex', gap: '1rem', alignItems: 'center' }}>
    <a href="/docs/writing-integrations" className="btn-primary" style={{ padding: '12px 24px', display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
      <span>Start Building Integrations â†’</span>
    </a>
    <a href="/integrations" className="btn-secondary" style={{ padding: '12px 24px', display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
      <span>Integrations Gallery</span>
    </a>
  </div>
</div>

Also explore [integration recipes](/docs/recipes) for specific tools like [AWS](/docs/recipes/connecting-to-aws), [Datadog](/docs/recipes/connecting-to-datadog), and [GitHub](/docs/recipes/connecting-to-github).
