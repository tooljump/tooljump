Modern software engineering runs on an ecosystem of tools: GitHub, AWS, GCP, Azure, Datadog, PagerDuty, Terraform, CI/CD pipelines, feature flags, data warehouses, marketing tools and many more.

These tools are powerful but they have a major flaw: **they're not connected and don’t talk to each other**!

## The result?  
- Engineers spend countless hours context-switching, clicking through tabs, and hunting for information loosing focus and negatively impacting the developer productivity.  
- Critical knowledge lives in Slack threads, stale documentation, or in the heads of a few senior engineers, negatively affecting the overall developer experience.  
- Onboarding new engineers takes weeks and mistakes happen more often than anyone admits *(for example debugging the wrong environment or shipping to production instead of staging)*.

For leaders, this translates into **millions lost every year in wasted engineering time, slower delivery, and costly mistakes** - a silent tax on every software project.  

## The alternatives?
- **Developer portals tried to solve this.** But asking engineers to leave the tools they already use and open “yet another portal” doesn’t work.  
- **Documentation doesn’t solve this either.** Documentation is inherently static and gets outdated really quick and contributes more to losing focus rather than gaining development speed. 

## That’s why we built **ToolJump!**  

ToolJump brings **[Knowledge as a Service](/docs/knowledge-as-a-service)** directly into the tools your engineers already use, revolutionizing how teams approach [connecting tools](/docs/connecting-your-tools-resources) and improving [developer experience](/docs/developer-experience).  

Imagine a single bar that follows you across your tools - GitHub, AWS, Datadog, CI/CD - and instantly shows you valuable insights by connecting them together into one ecosystem. **No searching, no bookmarks, no context switching - just answers where you need them.**

Think of it as a GPS for your engineering tools: wherever you are, ToolJump shows you the path forward - whether it’s debugging logs, exploring related infra, or finding the right docs. **All without leaving the screen you’re already on.**

Here are just a few examples of how ToolJump can help:
- Jump instantly from a GitHub repo to the right logs in your monitoring system. <Link to="/integrations/github-datadog-logs-alerts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demo</Link>
- Navigate from a Github repo to the related infrastructure in your cloud provider with a single click. <Link to="/integrations/github-aws-infrastructure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demo</Link>
- Discover the URLs of every service, for every environment, by just looking at its repository. <Link to="/integrations/github-show-deployed-service-urls" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demo</Link> 
- See a clear label in your cloud provider when you’re working in production vs staging. <Link to="/integrations/aws-lambda-production-check" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demo</Link> 
- Show feature flags for a given repository <Link to="/integrations/github-launchdarkly" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demo</Link> 
- Define your company’s knowledge base as small, reviewable code snippets stored in source control - safe, auditable, and versioned.

With ToolJump, **teams spend less time wandering around and more time shipping.** That means higher focus, higher productivity, faster delivery with less operational mistakes and greater output with the same headcount.

- What used to take 5 - 10 minutes of tool-hopping now takes a few seconds. And that’s just for a single developer - now multiply it by 10, 50, or 200 engineers, and the impact becomes massive across the entire organization.  
- What used to require tribal knowledge is now encoded and shared across the entire organisation.  
- And what used to be risky guesswork is now a guided, reliable, deterministic path.  

**ToolJump implements [Knowledge as a Service](/docs/knowledge-as-a-service) by [connecting your tools](/docs/connecting-your-tools-resources), your people, and the knowledge in your organisation.**

It transforms scattered information into living, contextual guidance - so your engineers can focus on building, not searching, while dramatically improving the [developer experience](/docs/developer-experience). This approach to [connecting tools](/docs/connecting-your-tools-resources) creates a seamless workflow that eliminates context switching and accelerates productivity.
