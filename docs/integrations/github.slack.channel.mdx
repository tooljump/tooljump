## How does this help you?

* Quickly find the Slack channel associated with this repository
* Jump straight into Slack via a deep link

## High level approach
We assume a local data file maps repositories to Slack channels. The integration reads the mapping, finds the channel for the current repo (tag key `repository`, value from the GitHub page), and renders a link to Slack.

Example data file (`slack-channels.data.json`):
```json
{
  "mappings": {
    "company/webshop": "#webshop",
    "company/notifier": "#alerts-notifier"
  }
}
```

:::tip
The prefered way of obtaining this information is if you use a Service/Inventory Catalog solution, which you can read this information from via API access.

## Prerequisites
No external auth required. Add a data file (e.g., `slack-channels.data.json`) to your data directory. Learn more in [Data files](/docs/writing-integrations/data).
