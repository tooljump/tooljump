## High level approach
There are two common ways to map a repository to its deployed URLs:

1. Data file (simple): Keep a small mapping file alongside your integrations that lists, for each repo, the staging and production URLs. This is easy to start with and versionâ€‘controlled.
2. Service catalog (scalable): Query your source of truth (e.g., Backstage, Datadog Service Catalog) to resolve environment endpoints dynamically. This is preferable when you already maintain a catalog.

Below, we implement approach number 1 (the simple data file approach) and render a dropdown with links to staging and production.

### Example data file (`deployed-urls.data.json`)
```json
{
  "mappings": {
    "company/webshop": {
      "production": "https://webshop.company.com",
      "staging": "https://staging.webshop.company.com"
    },
    "company/notifier": {
      "production": "https://notifier.company.com",
      "staging": "https://staging.notifier.company.com"
    }
  }
}
```

## Prerequisites
No external auth required. Add the data file (e.g., `deployed-urls.data.json`) to your data directory in your Github repository. Learn more about data files in [Data](/docs/writing-integrations/data).
