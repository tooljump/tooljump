This integration helps engineers quickly identify when they're working with AWS Lambda functions in production environments. It displays a warning when the AWS account ID matches a configured production account.

## How does it help?

A large number of mistakes are being done when engineers believe a resource is not in production, when it actually is.

This integration:
- Displays "In production env!" with important status if it's a production account
- Shows nothing if it's not a production account

## Preview

<BarContentPreview data={[
    {
      type: 'text',
      content: 'In production env!',
      status: 'important'
    }
  ]} title="How it looks in the extension" />

## Configuration

The integration uses a simple account ID check. You'll need to update the `PRODUCTION_ACCOUNT_ID` constant in the integration file with your actual production AWS account ID.

```javascript
const PRODUCTION_ACCOUNT_ID = '12345678'; // Replace with your production account ID
```

## When it runs

This integration runs when:
- You're on an AWS Lambda function page (`console.aws.amazon.com/lambda`)
- The AWS account ID is available in the context
- The service type is `lambda`

:::tip Alternative Detection Methods
While this integration only checks the account ID, you could also modify it to check for function name patterns like `-prod` or `-production` suffixes for additional environment detection.
:::

## Installation

1. Copy the integration file to your `examples/data/` directory
2. Update the `PRODUCTION_ACCOUNT_ID` with your actual production account ID
3. The integration will automatically be available when you visit AWS Lambda function pages

## Security Note

This integration only reads the account ID from the page context and doesn't make any external API calls, making it safe to use without additional AWS credentials.
