## How does this help you?

- Quick, readable countdown for the next production deploy

## Preview

<BarContentPreview data={[
    {
      type: 'text',
      content: 'Next deploy in 2h',
      status: 'relevant'
    }
  ]} title="How it looks in the extension" />

## High level approach
Hardcode your organizationâ€™s deployment schedule (or read it via an API call from your CI/CD system) and compute the next matching slot relative to the current time. This example uses:

- Days: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
- Times: 09:00, 15:00, 20:00 (local time)

It returns a simple text item like `Next deploy: 1d 3h`

## Prerequisites
No external auth or data files required.

## Code
<CodeBlock language="javascript" title="github.next-deploy.integration.example.js">
{IntegrationCode}
</CodeBlock>

:::tip
You can also change the status to values like `important` or `relevant` (or do not set status) depending on how soon the next deploy is.
For example, if the next deploy is in 1h, it should be important and show with red. If it is in 3 hours, it can be shown wih yellow as relevant.
